# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview</br>

We took data of all Pewlett Hackard employees and tried to narrow down the employees that were going to be retiring soon by sorting employees based on their birth date. This would help Pewlett Hackard assess how many jobs should be opening up soon and stratagize on how to fill a large number of employees leaving the company. This analysis also helped us analyze employees that were eligable for a mentorship program.
