# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview</br>

We took data of all Pewlett Hackard employees and tried to narrow down the employees that were going to be retiring soon by sorting employees based on their birth date. This would help Pewlett Hackard assess how many jobs should be opening up soon and stratagize on how to fill a large number of employees leaving the company. This analysis also helped us analyze employees that were eligable for a mentorship program.

## Results</br>

* Out of 33,118 employees getting ready for retirment, only fifty-two are eligable for the mentorship program. </br>

* The top two titles returing are the senior engenieer and senior staff. Pewlett Hackard may want to ramp up their hiring and recruitment efforts in these areas first.</br>

* With only two managers retiring, it might be useful to shuffle some teams around to create larger orginizations or train additional mangers from the inside to take over these duties instead of recruiting people from outside of the orginization.</br>

* To help fill the gaps with senior engineer and senior staff titles, it may help to promote some regular staff and regular engineer roles to help fill the gaps while also recruiting
